          <h2>Legal Disclaimers</h2>

          <h3>Not a Law Firm — Not Legal Advice</h3>
          <p>SSDI Providers is <strong>not a law firm</strong> and does not provide legal advice, legal representation, or attorney services. The information provided on this website and through our services is for general informational and advocacy purposes only. Nothing on this website should be construed as legal advice or as creating an attorney-client relationship.</p>
          <p>Our team provides advocacy, social work, case management, and authorized representative services for IHSS (In-Home Supportive Services) recipients in the State of California. When legal representation is needed — including but not limited to court proceedings, administrative law matters, or complex legal disputes — we refer clients to qualified, licensed attorneys.</p>
          <p><strong>If you need legal advice, please consult a licensed California attorney.</strong></p>

          <h3>Authorized Representative Services</h3>
          <p>We may serve as your authorized representative at State fair hearings and in dealings with county IHSS offices, as permitted under California Welfare and Institutions Code. An authorized representative is not an attorney and does not provide legal representation. Authorized representatives assist with advocacy, evidence gathering, and hearing preparation in an administrative (non-court) capacity.</p>

          <h3>No Guarantee of Outcome</h3>
          <p>While we strive to achieve the best possible results for our clients, we make <strong>no guarantees or warranties</strong> regarding the outcome of any appeal, fair hearing, protective supervision request, or other IHSS-related matter. Every case is unique, and outcomes depend on individual circumstances, evidence, county policies, and administrative law judge decisions.</p>
          <p>Past results, testimonials, or case examples described on this website do not guarantee or predict future outcomes.</p>

          <h3>Informational Purposes Only</h3>
          <p>All content on this website — including information about IHSS programs, fair hearings, protective supervision, California regulations, deadlines, forms, and procedures — is provided for general informational purposes only. While we make reasonable efforts to keep this information accurate and up to date, we do not warrant or guarantee its accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.</p>
          <p>California IHSS policies, regulations, and procedures may change at any time. For the most current information, consult the California Department of Social Services (CDSS), your local county IHSS office, or a licensed attorney.</p>

          <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
          <p>This website may contain links to external websites, government agencies, or third-party resources. These links are provided for convenience only. We do not endorse, control, or assume responsibility for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party websites.</p>

          <h3>California-Specific Services</h3>
          <p>Our services are specific to the State of California and the California IHSS program. Information and guidance provided may not be applicable to other states or programs.</p>
