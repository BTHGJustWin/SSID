      "q1": {
        "q": "What is the difference between SSI and SSDI?",
        "a": "SSI (Supplemental Security Income) is a needs-based program for people with limited income and resources who are aged, blind, or disabled. SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) is based on your work history and the Social Security taxes you've paid. You may qualify for one or both programs depending on your situation. We can help you determine which benefits you're eligible for.",
        "cat": "general"
      },
      "q2": {
        "q": "How much does your service cost?",
        "a": "We offer a free initial consultation to assess your situation. Our fees vary depending on the services you need. For SSDI cases, many representatives work on a contingency basis — meaning you only pay if you win your case. We'll explain all costs upfront before any work begins so there are never any surprises.",
        "cat": "general"
      },
      "q3": {
        "q": "What languages do you offer services in?",
        "a": "We provide full services in English, Spanish, Farsi (Persian), and Tagalog (Filipino). All of our documents, consultations, and communications are available in these four languages. If you need support in another language, contact us and we'll do our best to accommodate you.",
        "cat": "general"
      },
      "q4": {
        "q": "How do I know if I qualify for SSI?",
        "a": "To qualify for SSI, you must be aged 65 or older, blind, or disabled, AND have limited income and resources. For 2024, the resource limit is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Income limits vary by state. California has higher SSI payment amounts than the federal minimum. We can evaluate your specific situation to determine eligibility.",
        "cat": "ssi"
      },
      "q5": {
        "q": "How long does the SSI application process take?",
        "a": "The SSI application process typically takes 3 to 6 months for an initial decision. If your claim is denied and you need to appeal, the process can take longer — sometimes 12 to 24 months through all appeal levels. We work to ensure your initial application is as strong as possible to improve your chances of first-time approval.",
        "cat": "ssi"
      },
      "q6": {
        "q": "What qualifies as a disability for SSDI?",
        "a": "The Social Security Administration defines disability as a medical condition that prevents you from performing substantial gainful activity (SGA) and is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. This includes both physical and mental conditions. The SSA maintains a 'Blue Book' listing of qualifying impairments, but you can also qualify if your combined conditions prevent you from working.",
        "cat": "ssdi"
      },
      "q7": {
        "q": "How many work credits do I need for SSDI?",
        "a": "Generally, you need 40 work credits for SSDI, with 20 of those credits earned in the last 10 years. You can earn up to 4 credits per year. Younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For example, if you become disabled before age 24, you may only need 6 credits earned in the 3 years before your disability began.",
        "cat": "ssdi"
      },
      "q8": {
        "q": "What happens if my disability claim is denied?",
        "a": "If your claim is denied, you have 60 days to appeal. The appeals process has four levels: Reconsideration, hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), Appeals Council review, and Federal Court review. Statistics show that many claims are approved at the ALJ hearing level. Our appeals support service guides you through each level with thorough preparation.",
        "cat": "disability"
      },
      "q9": {
        "q": "Can I work while receiving disability benefits?",
        "a": "Yes, with limitations. SSDI has a Trial Work Period (TWP) that allows you to test your ability to work for 9 months without losing benefits. After the TWP, you enter a 36-month Extended Period of Eligibility. SSI has different rules — your benefits are reduced based on your earnings but not immediately eliminated. We can explain how working affects your specific benefits.",
        "cat": "disability"
      },
      "q10": {
        "q": "What documents do I need to apply?",
        "a": "You'll typically need: Social Security card or number, birth certificate, medical records and doctor contact information, work history for the past 15 years, tax returns or W-2 forms, bank statements (for SSI), and any documentation of your medical conditions. We help you gather and organize all required documents to ensure nothing is missing from your application.",
        "cat": "process"
      },
      "q11": {
        "q": "How long does the entire process take from start to finish?",
        "a": "The timeline varies by case. An initial application decision typically takes 3 to 6 months. If approved on the first attempt, you could receive benefits within that timeframe. If denied and you need to appeal, the process can extend to 12-24 months or more, depending on your local hearing office's backlog. We work diligently to move your case forward as quickly as possible.",
        "cat": "process"
      },
      "q12": {
        "q": "Do I need to see the Social Security Administration in person?",
        "a": "Not necessarily. Many aspects of the application can be handled online or by phone. However, some situations may require an in-person visit to your local SSA office. If a Consultative Examination (CE) is requested, you'll need to attend that medical appointment. We help you prepare for any required meetings or examinations.",
